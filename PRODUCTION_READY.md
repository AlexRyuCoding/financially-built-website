## Before First Deployment

### Required: Update Domain URLs

After your first Vercel deployment, update these files with your actual domain:

**`/src/data/site-meta.json`**

```json
{
  "site": {
    "url": "https://your-actual-vercel-url.vercel.app"
  },
  "openGraph": {
    "url": "https://your-actual-vercel-url.vercel.app"
  }
  // Update all URL references
}
```

**`/public/robots.txt`**

```
Sitemap: https://your-actual-vercel-url.vercel.app/sitemap.xml
```

### Recommended: Add Branded Images

Replace placeholder with your branded images:

- `/public/og-image.jpg` (1200x630px) - for social media sharing
- `/public/logo.png` - your official logo

Placeholder created at `/public/og-image-placeholder.svg`

---

## Optional Integrations

### Email Service (for form submissions)

Add to Vercel environment variables:

```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_key
CONTACT_EMAIL=contact@financiallybuilt.com
```

Then update `/src/app/api/submit-form/route.ts` with email logic.

### Analytics

Add to Vercel environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

The Analytics component will automatically activate.

---

## Deploy to Vercel

### Method 1: Vercel CLI (Fastest)

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

### Method 2: Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Click "Deploy" (uses defaults)
4. Done!

2. **Option B**: Email Service (SendGrid, AWS SES)

   - Add API key to environment variables
   - Uncomment email code in `/src/app/api/submit-form/route.ts`

3. **Option C**: CRM Integration (HubSpot, Salesforce)
